We will use these libraries heavily throughout the major programming assignments.\n","   *  You should read the instructions and run the code blocks sequentially.  \n","   In $10$ places you are reqired to complete missing python commands or answer short questions (look for the **TODO** comments, or notations like **(T3)** etc.). Try to understand the flow of this document and the code you run.\n","   * Start by loading the provided jupyter notebook file (*Short_HW1.ipynb*) to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a very convenient online tool for running python scripts combined with text, visual plots, and more. \n","   * Alternatively, you can [install jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) locally on your computer and run the provided notebook there.\n","* Second and third parts: questions on probability and linear algebra to refresh your memory and prepare for the rest of this course.  \n","The questions are mostly analytic but also require completing and running simple code blocks in the jupyter notebook.\n","   * Forgot your linear algebra? Try watching [Essence of LA](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) or reading [The Matrix Cookbook](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf).\n","   * Forgot your probability?

However, notice that some of the outputs may be cropped (become invisible), which can harm your grade.\n","\n","To prevent this from happening, tune the \"scale\" of the printed file, to fit in the *entire* output.
